answer = get_string("What's your name?\n")
is now
print("hello, " + answer)

You don't have to tell the computer what kind of variable is put in the values.
print(f"hello, {answer}")  - you can concactonate using comma and seperates as a string because print takes in multiple values. 
format string, f string. Tells python PLUG value in that placed between curly braces.
